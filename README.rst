==================


Our Dublin Bikes project is an interactive interface where users can view real-time station information and get predicted occupancies for selected bike stands.


Description
===========

This application was developed through Flask.
To view the application please follow the link below:

http://ec2-54-194-137-72.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:5000

If you would like to run the application yourself, please clone the repository and run the runme.sh file in the Flask app directory, remember to install the requirements.txt to ensure that you have alll the correct modules installed. 

The aim of the application is to give users up to date and real-time information on station occupancy, display the average occupancy of stations so users may be able to plan their trips, and also provide a predicitve feature that will incoperate the weather conditions at the time of the trip in the predictions resulting in a more accurate suggested occupancy.

This project was developed by Amy McCormack, Aoife O'Sullivan and Muireann MacCarthy.
